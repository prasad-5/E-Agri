<li>The pesticide should be used in the right dose only depending on the severity of the pest.</li>
<li>Farmers should install lamp baits in the field and analyse the extent to which different types of insects can cause damage depending on the number of insects attracted to it and use pesticides only as per the advice of experts only if required based on that information.</li>
<li>If discretion is not followed, the insects will not be destroyed, but the friendly insects such as spiders, wasps, aphids, knitted winged insects will become extinct and harmful insects will flourish well.</li>

Leafy green mite infestation is seen about a month after sowing. These insects suck and eat the juice in the leaves of the ends of the branches. Expecting the ends of the lethal branches results in a lack of growth. The aphids come together in groups and suck the juice from the twigs, leaves and flowering berries. Due to this, the soot yeasts get infected and the leaf, flowering and fruits turn black and then the seeds are formed. Besan leafy insect coating lays white eggs on the embryos.

Later, the stem and twigs are formed as white mold screens, in which sclerosis the size of mustard seed is formed, leaves and berries are also infected, and blue-gray spots are formed on the gills of the fruit.
</li>
<li>
    When the pest plucks out the desired plants, only parts of the plant on the ground are peeled off, leaving the roots and fruits in the soil. Crop rotation should be done with crops like bajra and sorghum.
</li>
<li>
    Seed treatment should be done by adding 1 gram of carbendazim or 3 g of kafton per kilogram of seeds.

</li>
<li>
    Two kilograms of Trichodermaviridae formulation should be mixed with 50 kg of cattle manure, covered with polythene paper and sprayed after 15 days in one acre of land before sowing.

		<h4>
            Amudam Comprehensive Protection
		</h4>
<p>
    The castor crop, especially the caterpillar, the caterpillar, and the caterpillars, can cause severe damage, and the blights and shoots also cause more damage. In the plant stage, the red caterpillar destroys the plants expected in july-august month. In the growing crop, the leaf is severely damaged. The dosari mite makes holes in the leaves from July to October, leaving only the leaf stalks and this month. They are also found on gels. Caterpillar produces castor crop in September-November and causes severe damage by creating holes in the leaves. This mite also bites and eats the fruits. The dry disease occurs up to 20-60 days after planting. If infected at the plant stage, the leaves wilt first and then the plant dries up. It expects the crop. Brown spots are formed during the gestation phase and the fruit becomes soft and decomposes first. Mold appears on the gela. Comprehensive plant protection measures. In the areas where dry rot is observed, the tolerant jyoti type and GCH-4, DCH-32, DCH-117, hybrids should be sown. In areas where the dry disease is severe, the crop should be transplanted with sorghum or bajra crops for 2-3 years. The intensity can be reduced.
</P>
<p>
    Infected plants should be uprooted and destroyed as soon as they are detected.
</P>

<p>
    In Aruna, Kranti and Desi varieties, trichoderma biocontrol fungus (white powder) should be treated with 10 g per kg of seed. Carbendazim should be mixed with 2g of 1 kg per seed and seed purification should be done.


</P>
<p>
    Red pebbles are more likely to occur in areas with light soils. If all the farmers set fires collectively between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. for 2-3 consecutive days after the onset of heavy rains, or if lamp baits are placed near the wells where there is electricity, the winged insects will be attracted. Without entering the crop in groups, the fields should be surrounded by a snare, the leaves of the forest castor, and the leaves of the wild castor should be used as bait and the insects should be picked up and killed.
</P>
<p>
    Take a deep plough around the field and spray the pesticide (endosulfan or quinolphos) powder in it to prevent insects from travelling from one field to another.
</P>
<p>
    After the second weeding of the castor crop, 10 bird bases per acre (panga sticks) are placed in favour of the birds to bend, the intensity will be reduced.
</P>
<p>
    After one month of germination of the seed, the caterpillar and winged mite should be sprayed in 5 ml of water without laying a large number of eggs in the crop.
</P>

<p>
    2-3 sexually transmitted baits per acre should be arranged, the presence of insects should be ascertained and their preventive measures should be taken.
</P>
<p>
    At the age of 30-60 days, the crop expects dasari mites.As soon as the green eggs are observed separately at the base of the leaf, the trichogramma parasitic egg shells should be cut into one or two pieces per acre and sewed to the leaves scattered in the field, or within a period of four days, the MP virus solution should be mixed with 200 lylused per acre with jaggery and 50 ml of jaggery and <> ml of jaggery per acre.
</P>
<p>
    If the number of adult mites is high, add 1.5 g of Bt medicine or quinolphos 2 ml per liter of water and spray it to wet the underside of the leaves.
</P>
<p>
    From the month of august, microplitis is the most desirable organism. This mite can be easily detected by the farmers. If the mite is found in 50 per cent of the insects on the plant, then there is no need to spray medicines for the prevention of the mite.
</P>
<p>
    At the base of the infected leaves, the insect swarms in the early stages and such leaves should be easily identified, picked up and destroyed from a distance.
</P>

<p>
    The bollworm should pluck the bolls as soon as expected and co-destroy them with the insects. If the intensity is high, spray Monocrotophos (1.5 ml/lit of water) or Chlorpyriphos (2 ml/lit of water).
</P>
<p>
    In September and October, when the soil is high during the sowing stage of the crop, and the night temperature is less than 22 degrees Celsius for about four to five days in a row, the fungus disease is more expected. Since there are no fully resistant varieties of the disease, the infected seedlings can be cut off and destroyed and the fungicide called carbendazim can be sprayed twice in a span of 10 days depending on the intensity of the twigs.
</P>
<p>
    Sowing individual varieties of bollworms can reduce the severity of bollworm and mould pests.
</P>
<p>
    Deep ploughing of the soil in the summer can destroy insects, fungi and bacteria in the coarse stage.
</P>
<p>
    Rainwater should not be stored in the field.
</P>




<h5 class="thead">
    Sorghum crop
		</h5>

		<h4>
            Sorghum crop harvesting
		</h4>
<p>
    Among the pests that cause severe damage to the jowar crop are the moth-borer, panicle, lice, matchworm and molestation.
</P>
<p>
    A fly that sheds the crop causes extensive damage within a month from the time of sowing. The stem borer comes from two weeks after sowing to the time of harvesting. As a result of biting, the bud dries up and gradually dies, and the dried buds come easily when plucked, causing extensive damage.
</P>

<p>
    If you sow within 7-10 days of the kharif season and the last week of September to the first week of October in rabi, the fly can be avoided to a great extent.
</P>
<p>
    Sorghum crop can also be protected from flies by using more than 1-1.5 kg of seed per acre while sowing the seed and sowing the plants closely in the fields and removing the infected plants.
</P>
<p>
    Plants that have been infected by a fly or stem borer must be removed from the field and destroyed.
</P>
<p>
    Harvesting close to the ground while harvesting the crop and destroying the crop residues in the soil can destroy the coagulation stages of insects such as stem borer and caterpillar.
</P>
<p>
    Deep ploughing in summer can lead to the destruction of insect repellents in the soil, in the weeds, in the soil, under the influence of birds or by the heat of the sun. This can reduce the infestation of the pest in the upcoming crop.
</P>

<p>
    Sowing the same type of sorghum on time, at the same time, in large areas can reduce the infestation of muvva fly, panicle, and matchworms.
</P>
<p>
    The use of sorghum as an intercropping can not only reduce the intensity of stem borer by up to 50 per cent, but also increase the yield of the crop by 10-12 per cent.
</P>
<p>
    Sorghum varieties (M35-1, CHH-15R) that are resistant to pests and give good yield during rabi crop season. Similarly, DSV-3 and DJ-6514 are pest-resistant varieties. Disinfectants should be used as a last resort only if necessary.
</P>
<p>
    Carbofuran 3G capsules should be applied at the rate of 2 g per metre of water at the rate of 35 g per metre at the rate of 2 g per metre of water for the prevention of the wilting fly. Ando sulphon 7 EC14 ml per litre of water should be sprayed within 21,<>,<> days of seed germination.
</P>
<p>
    Carbofuran 3G pellets should be applied in the plant folds 2-3 capsules 25 and 35 days after germination at the rate of plant per plant for the prevention of stem borer.
</P>

<p>
    Endosulfan 4D for the prevention of panicle and matchworms. Or malathion 5d medicines should be used at the rate of 8 kg per acre. If lice are expected, spray metacystox or Nuvacron 2.ml per liter of water after 40 days of germination.
</P>
<p>
    The seed should be purified and sown with Captan (3 g/kg per seed) to prevent bites. Ariofangin 200 ppm and Captan (2 g/l) should be sprayed together.
