        </h5>
        <p>
            In organic farming, mixed crops, multiple or multicropping and intercrops must be cultivated properly. Different crop plants absorb the nutrients they want from different depths of the soil. If some crops are cultivated together as mixed crops, the crops will grow well. So two or more varieties of crops can be cultivated depending on their needs. Moreover, mixed and multi-crops can reduce the infestation of pests. Crop rotation plays an important role in keeping the soil healthy and in the natural functioning of microorganisms. The different types of crop rotation methods were decided long in advance, region-wise. For example, aparas - grain piers - aparas.

They can produce up to 20-80 kg of nitrogen per acre. Can stabilize. Due to its impact, the yield is 20-30 per cent per acre It grows. 16-32 kg of nitrogen is stored in the earth Useful for later piers. due to the use of rhizobium The roots are well developed, expanded, and healthy on them Blisters are formed. Rhizobium bacteria present in these blisters Microorganisms stabilize the nitrogen present in the air and supply it to the plant.

    (ii.) Bait crops
</h5>
<p> 
    Worms are more likely to lay eggs and eat them The crop is placed on the bunds of the main crop, or in the middle of the field But it can be planted as bait crops. If so, the worms Lay eggs on them. Then the bait crops are plucked and It can be crushed or crushed. For example, in the cabbage crop, mustard seeds are used as bait crop, Cabbage borer, leaf worm and honey can prevent snow mite. The ball plant is fed as a bait crop and the fruit borer, Put the corn as a bait crop in the boils and peel the fruit Insects can be effectively controlled.
</p>


<h5 class="thead">
    (iii.) Intercropping
</h5>
<p> 
    Intercropping of one crop with another crop due to the extrusion or slinging in different crops Insects on the host crop due to the spraying of chemicals Progeny of insects due to difficulty in detection Living is reduced. For example, cabbage tomato or an intercropping diamond with carrot crops Spotted mites, peanut slags By planting intercropping, the leaf borer, By planting the pea as an intercrop in cheraku The mite can be controlled.
